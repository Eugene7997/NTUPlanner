# CZ2006-Team Lyon

Hi! We are team lyon and here is our application for our CZ2006 Project.
NTUPlanner is a web application that strives to provide an improved timetable planning 
experience for NTU students. NTUPlanner aims to provide an effortless experience for students to 
experiment and try out different combinations of lesson time slots suited for themselves. An 
integrated map page also seeks to allow students to make better choices during timetable planning. 
Together, NTUPlanner provides a simple way to plan timetables for a semester
